# Cyberbullying Text Classification

This Jupyter notebook demonstrates the process of building and evaluating a machine learning model for classifying cyberbullying text.

## Instructions

1. Ensure you have the following libraries installed: pandas, scikit-learn, and shap.
2. Download the notebook and the associated data file (`cyberbullying_data.csv`) to your local machine.
3. Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
4. Run the cells in the notebook sequentially.
5. The output of the final cell will be the predicted class of the new text data.

## Additional Information

The notebook uses the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) library to explain the model's predictions.
The notebook also includes code to generate a word cloud of the most frequent words in the data.
The data used in the notebook is a subset of the data from the Kaggle competition on Cyberbullying Detection.
